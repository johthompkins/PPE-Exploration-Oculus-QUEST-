PPE Exploration is an outreach demo designed to teach the user more about Power Propulsion Element(PPE).​As you walk through the you start to add more components of PPE and what each part does. Later after building​ PPE you are able to then combine it to the Deep Space Gateway and see what it will look like as a whole unit.​

This Repo only shows in game screen shots since the NASA GRC facility owns the code.
